        <p><b><a href="https://github.com/BodyFatControl/documentation/wiki">Body Fat Control</a></b> are a free and OpenSource Android mobile and Android Wear watch apps that work together to help users daily control their balance of calories consumed versus calories spent. By controlling this balance is possible to manage the amount of fat stored on the body.</p>
        <p>From my experience, is important to control the balance/quantity of calories and also the "quality of food" - for instance, eating 400kcals of a whole wheat bread is preferable than eating the same amount of 400kcals of sweet cake. Resuming: control the calories consumed versus calories spent and also prefer health food.</p>
        <p><b>How it works</b><br>
        - The watch app (developed and tested on Polar M600 watch) measures automatically the calories spent by the user and syncs this information with the mobile app (measures user heart rate ever minute to calculate spent calories)<br>
        - The user logs his meals on the mobile app and will see the historic graph of the day with the consumed calories and the spent calories<br></p>
        <p>To verify the results/close the loop is recommended the users to measure theirs body fat. I use Nokia Body+ bathroom scale that measures body fat, muscle, water and bone mass.<br>
        I also use <a href="https://www.skulpt.me/">Skulpt Scanner</a> to measure body fat and muscle.</p>
