        <p><b><a href="https://github.com/BodyFatControl/documentation/wiki">Body Fat Control</a></b> is a free and OpenSource Android app and Garmin app, to help users daily control their balance of calories consumed versus calories spent. By controlling this balance is possible to manage the amount of fat stored on the body.</p>
        <p>From my experience, is important to control the balance/quantity of calories and also the "quality of food" - for instance, eating 400kcals of a whole wheat bread is preferable than eating the same amount of 400kcals of sweet cake. Resuming: control the calories consumed versus calories spent and also prefer health food.</p>
        <p><b>How it works</b><br>
        - The Body Fat Control app running on <a href="https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/p/538374">Garmin v√≠voactive HR</a> measures automatically the calories spent by the user and syncs this information with the Android app<br>
        - The user logs his meals on the Android Body Fat Control app and will see the historic graph of the day with the consumed calories and the spent calories<br></p>
        <p>To verify the results/close the loop is recommended the users to measure theirs body fat. I recommend using the <a href="https://www.skulpt.me/">Skulpt Scanner</a> - I measure everyday my muscles (mainly the ABS) using Skulpt Scanner.</p>
        <p>For the full information, please visit the <a href="https://github.com/BodyFatControl/documentation/wiki">Body Fat Control website</a>.</p>
